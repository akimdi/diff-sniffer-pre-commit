This tool allows you using [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) as a pre-commit hook. The main difference from [existing solutions](https://github.com/s0enke/git-hooks/blob/master/phpcs-pre-commit/pre-commit) that this one validates only changed lines of code but not the whole source tree.

Installation
------------

Diff Sniffer is already built as PHAR-package with a few predefined configurations. All you need is download it and install as a pre-commit hook.
```
$ wget https://github.com/morozov/diff-sniffer-pre-commit/releases/download/2.3.0/pre-commit.phar
$ chmod +x pre-commit.phar
$ mv pre-commit.phar /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

You can also install and configure Diff Sniffer manually.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:morozov/diff-sniffer-pre-commit.git
$ composer update
$ ln -s /path/to/diff-sniffer-pre-commit/bin/pre-commit /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/
```

Configuration
-------------

The coding standard used by default may be defined in config.php (the release package is pre-configured with PSR2). Similarly to PHP_CodeSniffer, both embedded and custom standards may be used.
```php
<?php

return array(
    '--standard=Zend',
);
```

or

```php
<?php

return array(
    '--standard=/path/to/custom/standard',
);
```

If you want to reuse the same installation of Diff Sniffer with different standards, you can pass `--standard` as command line option. You should use shell script wrapper as pre-commit hook instead of symlink then.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

/path/to/diff-sniffer-pre-commit/bin/pre-commit --standard=PEAR
```
